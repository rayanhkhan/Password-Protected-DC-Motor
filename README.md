# Password-Protected-DC-Motor
In today’s modern digital world, security and access control have become a rising concern in safeguarding sensitive information and secure details. From personal devices to industrial machinery, we need reliable authentication and safe access control mechanisms more than ever. In the realm of microcontroller systems, the Password Protected DC Motor project lets us create a significant application that addresses this demand for secure control and operation of essential devices. 

In this report, we will dive into the project's system design, development, and implementation, detailing the core components of our Password Protected DC Motor system. We will provide insights into the fundamental concepts of microcontroller programming, electronic circuitry, and security systems, which describe the functionality of our system. Additionally, we will describe the challenges encountered during the project, our problem-solving approach, and the lessons learned throughout the development process of this project. 

The objectives of our project are: 

● To develop a password protected motor system 

● To only let the dedicated user use the device 

● To make it easier for the user to operate the motor after accessing the controls 

● To learn the art of writing and debugging codes 

● To understand the interfacing between different input and output devices within the microcontroller 

● To be able to match theoretical knowledge in the world of practical implementations
